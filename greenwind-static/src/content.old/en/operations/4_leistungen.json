  "t2": "All operating procedures of wind farms and substations are mapped 24/7 in our control centres. The main control centre and heart of operations is in Berlin. We document, systemise, monitor and control plant operations and plant conditions. This enables optimal guiding and efficient use of all operating teams and their activities. All core processes are monitored and coordinated centrally – 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nEffective and safe.",

Furthermore, all events are recorded, faults are dealt with, and planned maintenance/repair work coordinated. We specialise – both onshore and offshore – in wind power plants, substations, cable systems and offshore platforms, such as in the maintenance management of the grid connection system DolWin3.\n Certified in accordance with ISO 9001, with preparation underway for ISO 14001, ISO 55000, and ISO 27001"

We facilitate a variety of usage models and meet the very highest safety standards, thus putting the full range of greenwind control services at our customers’ disposal."

We have a close network, which provides inspiration and opens up new possibilities in terms of both technical and commercial management. Intelligent technology is one side of the equation. The expertise, ingenuity, and dedication of our team are the other. This plays an especially crucial role in the area of personal 24/7 monitoring."

      "p": "For many wind-power projects which were installed more than ten years ago, repowering is worthwhile - that is, an older and smaller plant is replaced by a new installation. The service life of an existing project can thus be extended by a further 20 years and the efficiency can be increased three- to five-fold. An investment can be quickly redeemed."
