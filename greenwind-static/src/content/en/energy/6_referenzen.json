They were put into operation in the first quarter of 2017, including a connecting substation in Kuhsdorf.\n\nRated power 48.3 megawatts \n\nThe construction of the new wind power plant with an axle-shaft height of 449.48 feet (137 m) and a rated power of 3,450 kilowatts (previously 1,500 kilowatts) took place within three months. 21 megawatts rated power were turned into 48.3 megawatts. Repowering increased the energy yield four-fold.. The wind farm is equipped with appropriate night identification.\n\nCompensatory measures\n\nUpon request of the municipality, as compensatory measures, buildings which were no longer required were demolished trees were planted and a traditional orchard was laid. Sand lizards were relocated to surrogate habitats. Bats received new nest boxes in three spots and nests were also placed for barn swallows.\n\nProject partner: European Energy\nTechnical operating management: Green Wind Operations\n\n",
