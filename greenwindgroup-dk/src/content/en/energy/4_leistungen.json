Only then is acceptance created which is absolutely essential for smooth operations. This includes optimal (license) agreements, expedient financing and leasing schemes, agreed offset projects such as provisions for protecting nature and conserving biodiversity.\n\nImplementing a wind-power project is a complex task. It takes some time before the rotor blades turn a profit. As a future wind farm operator, you retain one contact person who will make the process clear and open, and who will continue to advise you."

Investors who want to draw a lucrative profit from a worthwhile investment, communities which undertake new projects using commercial tax revenues as well as land owners, who lease their land for the construction of a plant.\n\nAt the beginning of every project, our financial management examines whether its implementation makes sense. A full costing analysis, incorporating optimised maintenance and leasing contracts, operating costs and direct marketing, is seen alongside a soundly forecasted income from the potential remuneration. We develop tailor-made financial models and bring together selected partners, institutions and banks at the right time."

The turnkey realisation includes the site selection, construction, commissioning and last but not least the grid connection. After all, wind power plants are power stations. They need to fulfill all the requirements of grid connection and integration in the power mix. It is also our job to implement this in accordance with all the statutory regulations of the German Renewable Energy Act (EEG), the requirements of the network operators as well as those of the manufacturer and operator and in regard to future grid concepts."
